### API for solving large scale travelling salesman/fleet routing problems

You have a fleet of just 10 vehicles to serve 500 spots in the city. Some vehicles are only available in the day. Some stops can only be served at night. How would you solve this problem?

You don't need to. Just throw us a list of stops, vehicles and depots and we will do the heavy lifting for you. *Routing as a Service!*

**BETA RELASE:**  ElasticRoute is completely free-to-use until 30th April 2020!
